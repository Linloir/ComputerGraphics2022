This is a repo for my projects of computer graphics course.

## Details about this repo

The repo is an integration of all my assignments thoughout the term, while each assignments lies in a individual folder named by its purpose.

If you really want to try out my codes, which I definitely do not recomment you to do it, the repo is already configured for VS Code.
